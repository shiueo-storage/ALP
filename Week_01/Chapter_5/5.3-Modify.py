# Starter Code

number = 5
print("I have thought of a number between 1 and 10")  # the number is 5
guess = int(input("Can you guess what it is?"))  # get input from the user


if guess < number:  # if the input number is less than 5, print "Too Low!"
    print("Too Low!")
if guess > number:  # if the input number is greater than 5, print "Too High!"
    print("Too High!")

# so, If the guessed number is 5, it prints nothing
