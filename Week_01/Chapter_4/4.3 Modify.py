# Starter code

num1 = 10
num2 = int(input("Enter a number."))

total1 = num1 + num2

print(str(num1) + " plus " + str(num2) + " = " + str(total1))

mul1 = num1 * num2
print(str(num1) + " times " + str(num2) + " = " + str(mul1))

# Instructions

# Line 4 creates an error. Look carefully to see what is wrong with the code and fix it.
# it's string, not converted to integer type. We need to add int() to make it works correctly

# Add a text prompt between lines 3 and 4 to tell the user to enter a number.

# Complete line 8 to concatenate total 1 into the output statement.

# Add a new variable with a sensible identifier.  Multiply num1 and num2 together and assign the result into this variable.

# Output num1, num2 and your new variable in a similar format to line 8.
