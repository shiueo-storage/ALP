num1 = 20  # it makes a integer object and num1 variables point it.
num2 = 5  # it makes a integer object and num2 variables point it.

result = num1 * num2  # the integer object pointed by num1 and num2 multiplied and they make a new object which is the result of multiplication and it assigned to variable result

# This code uses input to assign data into a variable.  Add comments to explain how it works.
print("Enter a number")
num1 = int(input())  # in Python3 input data's type is string so we convert it to integer by using int()
num2 = 2

result = num1 // num2  # then we divide them and get only quotient

print(result)  # print it
