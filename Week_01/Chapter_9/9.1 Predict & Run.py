# Example Code 1

def say_hi():
  print("Why hello there!")

def offer_drink():
  print("Would you care for a spot of tea?")

def offer_food():
  print("Biscuit?")

def say_bye():
  print("Cheerio then.")


offer_drink() # run the subroutine offer_drink() -> print("Would you care ---")
say_hi() # run the subroutine say_hi() -> print("Why hello there?")
offer_food() # run the subroutinee offer_food() -> print("Bisquit.")

# Example code 2
def maths1():
  num1 = 50
  num2 = 5
  return num1 + num2

def maths2():
  num1 = 50
  num2 = 5
  return num1 - num2

  num1 = 50
  num2 = 5
  return num1 * num2

outputNum = maths2() # set variable outputNum as the subroutine maths2()
print(outputNum) # run the subroutine outputNum (actually maths2)

# Example Code 3
def location(country):
  print("I am from " + country)


location("Brazil") # it passes the string "Brazil" as the argument. so it will print : I am from Brazil
